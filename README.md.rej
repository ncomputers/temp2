+# Patch Automation Script
+
+This repository contains a simple Python script to apply a git patch and
+push the resulting changes. The script tries to merge the patch using a
+3-way merge. If conflicts occur, it keeps the incoming changes from the
+patch and discards the existing lines.
+
+## Usage
+
+1. Place your patch file in this directory as `code.patch` (or specify a
+   different path when running the script).
+2. Run the script:
+
+```bash
+python3 apply_patch.py [path/to/patch]
+```
+
+After applying the patch and resolving conflicts, the script commits and
+pushes the changes to the current repository.
